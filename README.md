# WUPAutoPacker

A simple Python script that automatically packs encrypted NUS packages into installable WUPs.

# Usage

Upon running the script, you will be asked to provide a valid common key dumped from a Wii U console. Once entered, simply enter the path to your NUS package you want to pack and it will do it automatically. The resulting WUP is stored in the output directory of the program folder.
